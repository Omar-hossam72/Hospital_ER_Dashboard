### Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project aims to provide actionable insights into Emergency Room (ER) performance by analyzing patient flow, wait times, satisfaction, and referral patterns. The dashboard is designed to help hospital management and staff make data-driven decisions for improving efficiency and patient care.

## Key KPIs & Metrics
- Monthly View → Track patient visits over time.
- Number of Patients → Total patient count.
- Average Wait Time → Average time patients spend before consultation.
- Patient Satisfaction Score → Measure service quality.
- Number of Patients Referred → Track referral cases to other departments.
- Patient Admission Status → Breakdown of Admitted vs. Cancelled cases.
- Patients by Gender → Gender distribution of ER visits.
- Patients by Race → Racial/ethnic distribution.
- Patients by Day & Hour → Identify peak times of ER activity.
- Patients by Department Referral → Which departments patients are most often referred to.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query / DAX)

## Dashboard Views
1. Monthly view to show all Data for each Month in the year
2. Consolidated View Dashboard → Overall ER performance KPIs and trends
3. Patient View Dashboard → Patient-level insights (demographics, admission status, satisfaction)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned data (handled missing values, duplicates, standardized categories).
- Descriptive stats for wait times, patient demographics, and admissions.
- Identified busiest days/hours and department referral patterns.
- Checked correlations (wait time vs satisfaction, cancellations by time).
- Flagged outliers (unusual wait times, inconsistent records).

## Insights Example
- Peak ER traffic occurs during late evenings (5 PM – 10 PM).
- Higher cancellation rates observed in specific departments.
- Female patients report slightly higher satisfaction scores compared to male patients.
